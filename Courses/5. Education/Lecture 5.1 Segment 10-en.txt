PROFESSOR: And it's not, of course, just an Indian problem.
We have the same problem in Kenya.
And I mentioned from France before, I think France also
has a little bit of that.
Trying to get rid of it slowly, but quite elitist curriculum.
In comparison to
Finland, for example, where kids do not
learn to read until age 7, and where
there is a huge emphasis on success
in primary grade on reading.
And Finland is the country in Europe.
In fact, in the OECD that has the best test scores
at the primary level.
So it's not a proof of that, but this is a sign
that this is not just this kind of elitism wing of test scores
is a kind of a worldwide phenomenon that
correlates with success.
So let me stop here for a minute if people have questions.

ASSISTANT: OK, so this is not really a question,
but there's quite a few people commenting in terms of examples
from their countries--
Ethiopia, Nigeria, for example--
where teachers are not highly paid,
and they're just wondering, is it
the comparison to other sectors that shows that--
PROFESSOR: Yeah, so what you have to think what highly paid
means is in a country, of course,
you cannot pay the teachers in Ethiopia the same as they are
paid in the US.
The question is, where teachers stand
relative to the rest of the salary level in the population.
And I don't know the situation of every single countries,
but I know many countries, and in general, in particular,
public school teachers tend to be at a much higher percentile
level of the country distribution in poor countries
than they are in rich countries.
And that's true for civil servants in general
who get a premium to be a civil servant as [INAUDIBLE] and Fred
Finan have shown that is much larger in developed countries.
And the result of that, actually,
is that those are jobs who are highly desired.
I have a project in Ghana, where we give a secondary school
scholarship to kids, and the most desirable outcome for them
is to get a job as a teacher.
And in fact, they wait for a very long time
until they can get a spot in the teacher college
in order to get those jobs.
And then once they get those jobs,
they suddenly get much, much more comfortable financially
than they came from.
So I think that's actually a reasonably general phenomenon,
but there might be exceptions that I don't know about.
ASSISTANT: And there's another question
from Priscilla Hamukwala.
In your experiments, has there been any systematic gender
differences in math skills?
If so, are there any particular factors
that contribute to that?
PROFESSOR: At the kids' level for small kids, no.
You find girls and boys doing just as well.
For the kids in markets, they are almost all boys,
so there was no girls to look at.

ASSISTANT: And then we have a couple
of questions about class size and how
that affects learning outcomes.

PROFESSOR: Surprisingly, unless it
leads to changes in pedagogy, it doesn't
tend to have a large effect in developing countries,
contrary to what we find in richer countries.
So for example, in Kenya, we had an experiment
where we divided class size in two,
and there was no impact if nothing else was changed,
if it was a regular teacher and there was no grouping of kids
by ability or achievement.
ASSISTANT: And one last question,
on the learning level, did you look at the role of language?
Does it make a difference if students
learn using their mother tongue as a medium of instruction?
PROFESSOR: So I haven't done studies like that,
but there are numbers of studies that look
at the medium of instruction.
I think the results tend to find that for early grades,
this is easier for children and they learn more
if the instruction is there in their own language,
and that's going to relate to some of the things
I'm going to talk just now.
I mean, that's, in some sense, relates to what I'm already
doing, which is that, for example, in Kenya, kids
are nominally taught in English, which for many children,
is their third language after their own local language
and then Swahili.
So in one of the very early randomized experiments
by Michael Kremer, he gave textbooks,
which were in English, and these textbooks had no impact
whatsoever, and one of the reasons
is that they were in English that most kids can't even read.
