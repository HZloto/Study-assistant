PROFESSOR: Somebody look for--
what is the GNI of the richest country?
Can you find some countries that are rich?
What is the GNI?
And we'll be using for-- looking for is the GNI per capita.
Not overall but per person.
Per capita means per person.
Any suggestions or any ideas?
Which countries are very rich?
Just suggest anything.
Yeah?
STUDENT: The US.
PROFESSOR: The US.
And how rich are the US according to your sheet?
STUDENT: Their GNI per capita is $70,430.
PROFESSOR: $70,400.
Pretty rich.
Pretty good.
But is that the richest country in the world, or what
other countries do we have?
STUDENT: Bermuda.
PROFESSOR: Bermuda.
And how rich is Bermuda?
STUDENT: $116,530 per capita.
PROFESSOR: That is exactly right.
So that's very rich.
It's also a very small country.
So do we have another country?
That's the richest country we have here in our data.
What's the second richest after that?

Yeah?
STUDENT: Switzerland.
PROFESSOR: Switzerland.
That's correct.
How rich is Switzerland?
STUDENT: $90,360 GNI per capita.
PROFESSOR: That's exactly right.
So $90,360.
This is income per year per person, OK?
So the average Swiss person earns or makes--
has about $90,000 available.
Notice this is all done in current exchange rates.
We just use whatever the exchange rate is.
And so we use whatever Swiss people produce, and then use
the exchange rate from the Swiss Franc to the US dollar
to convert what that is.
OK.
So those are the rich countries.
We already talked a little bit about the US.
Now, what is the GNI of the poorest country?

Any nominations?
STUDENT: Somalia.
PROFESSOR: Somalia.
How much-- what's the GNI for Somalia?
STUDENT: It says $450 per person.
PROFESSOR: $450.
OK.
Yeah?
STUDENT: Maybe Burundi?
PROFESSOR: Burundi.
Yeah.
How much is that?
STUDENT: I think it's $240.
PROFESSOR: $240.
That's exactly right.
So $240.
That's, as you can see, staggeringly lower.
That's much, much lower than Switzerland.
Much, much lower than Bermuda.
Also much, much lower than the US, as we just discussed.
$70,000.
OK.
These differences are huge.
And I just want to think about how huge these differences are.
What is the ratio between those two, between the US
and Burundi, roughly?

Anyone?
STUDENT: The ratio?
PROFESSOR: The ratio between the US and Burundi in terms of GNI.
STUDENT: Maybe around 1 to 340-ish.
PROFESSOR: 300 is pretty good.
So 293.
That's enormous.
Think about anybody that you know who you think
is pretty rich or less rich than you are
or your family might be.
Maybe they're twice as rich.
Maybe three times as rich.
Maybe four times.
Maybe half as rich.
Maybe a third.
These are already large differences.
This is 300 times as much money does
a US person have compared to somebody in Burundi,
on average, on any given day.
In fact, the GNI of the US per day is nearly as much
as the GNI for Burundi for the entire year.
A little bit less than that.
But essentially, how much money a US person has on any
given day is how much money a person in Burundi
has for most of the year.
So these are huge, huge differences.
Now, somebody was previously talking about prices,
or I think you were talking about prices.
I'm not-- what about prices?
This is using exchange rates.
Somebody was saying, we need to do something
with these exchange rates, or something is not quite right
perhaps.
Yeah?
STUDENT: Maybe you can assume that the average cost
of a good in a poor country is going
to be cheaper than the average cost of that same good
in a richer country.
PROFESSOR: Exactly.
Exactly.
If I buy things in the US, things
are going to be way more expensive than if I
buy things in other countries.
That's not true for all goods, but it's
particular for goods that are services.
As mentioned, a haircut, but all sorts
of other services that you might get
are a lot cheaper in countries with lower wages, for example,
than they are in the US.
OK?
So now, what do we do?
How do we deal with that?
Yeah?
STUDENT: Maybe we just take the average
of the cost of some very common goods and services
in this country and make that as the benchmark for the cost
of the goods in that country.
PROFESSOR: That's correct.
Anybody else?
Any thoughts?

I think that was very correct.
So essentially what one uses is the GNI per capita
PPP, which is referred to as Purchasing Power Parity.
This is complicated, but the simple version of that
is that one uses a basket of goods that are being produced
and then tries to figure out how much does this basket cost
in different countries, and then tries to adjust for that.
This is kind of complicated because people
consume different things in different places.
So you have to take into account how to do that.
But we will ignore that for now.
It's a complicated thing.
Assuming somebody is able to do this and look at Purchasing
Power Parity, essentially adjusting for price levels,
what do we get?
So are the income differences going
to be smaller or larger now once we use PPP?
STUDENT: Smaller.
PROFESSOR: Smaller.
And why is that?
Just very mechanically.
How much smaller do you think it will be?

I think you said smaller.
STUDENT: I don't think it's to be that much smaller, though.
PROFESSOR: Like twice or half as big?
STUDENT: Two to three times.
PROFESSOR: Two to three times.
Pretty good.
And why?
And the reason, of course, is that in poor countries,
we're comparing rich countries and poor countries
and find large differences.
Now we're going to say, well, in fact, with whatever income you
have in poor countries, you can buy more
because things are cheaper.
So then these differences will shrink.
So now we can look at our sheet again and see what
is the GNI using PPP of the US.
What do we find?

Yeah?
STUDENT: $70,480.
PROFESSOR: Yeah.
This is almost exactly the same as before.
It's using, I think, different prices in different years,
so it's slightly different.
But essentially, everything is relative to the US.
So this should be exactly or approximately the same.
OK?
So now, what about the poorest country using PPP?
What do we find?
STUDENT: Burundi?
Around $800.
PROFESSOR: And is that still the poorest country?

So Burundi is $800, we just said.
That's correct.
Yeah.
So Burundi is still the poorest country.
It's now about $800.
What's the ratio between those two?
You're pretty spot on, in fact.
It's now about 88, so that's about a third
of those differences.
Notice that these differences are still enormous.
88 times more money than somebody else
is a huge difference between being rich versus being poor.
Just happened to be born in a rich country
versus a poor country.
Notice that that is the average person.
It's just on average.
It's not a particular rich or poor person in the US
or in other places.
This is just the average person in those countries.
OK.
So now we talked about how big these differences are.
The next question we're going to ask
is, well, when you talk about the poor, whom
are we actually referring to?
Where can we find the poor?
Where are they to be found?
In which places?
And I'm going to ask you two questions.
One is, if you looked at 1800 or 200 years ago,
where would you find poor people,
and where would you find them now?

Yeah?
STUDENT: Now, people would be [INAUDIBLE] less urban areas,
whereas before they would usually
be in cities because that's where
all the opportunities were.
PROFESSOR: And in which countries, which parts
of the world?
STUDENT: In 1800s?
PROFESSOR: Yeah, anywhere, or now?

Anybody else?

So everywhere is actually exactly correct for 1800s.
If you look at 1800, you can see here
the distribution of income.
So you can see, essentially, the higher it is,
the more people are at a certain daily income per capita.
So you see on the x-axis income per capita
and how many people in the world are living
in the world for each income.
You see Europe, Asia-Pacific, Africa, and North and South
America sort of combined.
And what you see here in 1800, essentially,
pretty much everybody is poor, about something like 80%, 90%.
A lot of people are in Asia-Pacific, a lot of people,
in fact, in Europe, a lot of people in Africa,
and a lot of people in North and South America.
There's some people at the time were somewhat richer than that,
but pretty much everybody was poor at the time.
So if you wanted to find poor people at the time,
you could find them, essentially, everywhere
in the world, in cities as well as in rural areas.
Now, going forward, right now, where would
you find most poor people?

And I should be very clear about this,
as defined by extreme poverty as in below the poverty
line of about $2 per day.

STUDENT: Africa?
PROFESSOR: Africa?
Correct.

Anywhere else?
STUDENT: Asia.
PROFESSOR: Asia.
Yeah.
So Africa and Asia.
And so if you looked at 1975, in fact--
so remember red is Asia, blue is Africa.
So you see, in 1975, you'd see huge fractions of the poor,
in fact, are located in Asia and the Pacific.
You'll also see quite a few of them in Africa
and much fewer in Europe and in the Americas.
Now, if you do the same now in 2015,
you will see that a lot of the red mass
has shifted towards the right.
So lots of people in Asia have gotten richer.
But you'll see still quite a few people in Asia, as well as
in Africa.
And this is why, when you look at a lot of the studies
that you will see in this class, mostly
will be focused on African countries, as well as Asia--
in particular, India.
OK?
Now, somebody was saying previously-- sorry,
I should be very clear about this.
This is not to say that there is no poverty in the US.
Of course, there's lots of differences between the rich
and the poor in the US.
However, the levels of poverty in terms of just how much money
people have is quite different.
They are relatively poor compared
to other people in the US, but most people in the US
will be above the poverty threshold of about $2 per day.
Yeah?
STUDENT: Why isn't the poverty line further down in the 1800s?
PROFESSOR: This is sort of controlling
for price differences.
STUDENT: OK.
PROFESSOR: So it's essentially-- that's a great question.
That's what it says here at the bottom in the caption.
It says PPP adjusted, which essentially
tries to take into account that prices are, in fact, different.
Now that's a very hard thing to do
because you have to figure out what prices were
and what people consumed in 1800.
But to the best of our knowledge,
this is sort of the best we have.
So these prices here, $2, that's a different amount in 1800.
It's just converted into dollars now.
Good question.
Thank you.
